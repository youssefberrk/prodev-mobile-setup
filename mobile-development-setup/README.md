# React Native Mobile Development Setup Guide

## Objective
Mobile development requires robust tools and efficient workflows. This guide outlines the setup process for React Native development using the Expo Framework, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### Hardware Requirements
